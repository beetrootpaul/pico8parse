pico8parse uses a set of "features" to describe Lua versions. Here is the list of what each feature means and for the parsing of which version of Lua it is used.

## Unsorted Notes
.. and quite surely outdated.

### About File Format and Sections

The PICO-8 file format (.p8, text) defines a set of rules that must be followed
for a file to be correctly loaded:

   - the first line of the file must contain the mention "pico-8 cartridge"
     (16 characters, case sensitive) any character may be present before and
     after (no new-line sequence before, obviously)

   - the next line is entirely ignored (may it contain one of the sequences
     specified after, it is not parsed and is discarded)

   - there exists (as of 0.2.2) 7 sections in a p8 file each identified by a
     set sequence of character (similar to Python's dunders); a generic
     `__meta:*__` is introduced in 0.2.4c

   - a section is entered as soon as a line containing on of these sequences is
     passed; the following lines are part of said section until any next one
     of these or EOF

   - these sequences are only valid section opening if they are present at
     the very beginning of the line; any amount of any character may follow

   - outside of section (typically right after the "pico-8 cartridge" header,
     before any sequence), lines are simply discarded

   - as a section is closed by a new one, multiple section under the same
     sequence can be present within the file; section for a given sequence are
     concatenated in order of appearance

   - only within a __lua__ section may PICO-8 Lua be parsed, starting on the
     very next line

   - a __lua__ section may be closed at any point (eg. in the middle of an
     assignment) and resume in a next __lua__ section, this is still considered
     valid

   - _usually_, the first line is as bellow, the second line present a version
     number (noted VER) and each section is present once in the order of the
     list of sequences hereafter

### About Other PICO-8 Specific Features
The added syntaxes for `singleLine[..]` are pretty broken, see this
[test](../test/scaffolding/conditional) for some kind of overview.

With singleLineIf, the following becomes valid (note the 'do'):
```bnf
   if ::= 'if' '(' exp ')' 'do' block {elif} ['else' block] 'end'
```

This snippet has an error (missing space after "name()" -- fixed above 0.2.4):
```lua
function name()if (exp) block
    block
end
```

This snippet prints "no":
```lua
if (1) do local a = "yes"
    print(a or "no")
end
```

And so does this on:
```lua
if (nil) else do local a = "yes"
    print(a or "no")
end
```

So the actual added syntax is closer to:
```bnf
   if ::= '\s' 'if' '(' exp ')'
         [ block [ 'else' [ 'do' block_else_do '\n' ]
                   block_else_then
                 ] '\n'
         | [ 'do' block_if_do '\n'
           | 'then'
           ] block_if_then {elif} ['else' block] 'end'
         ]
```
.. where `block_if_do` has for parent `block_if_then` and `block_else_do` has
for parent `block_else_then`...

`singleLineIf` and `singleLineWhile` cannot be empty; `if (1)` error,
`if (1) else` no error, `if (1) end do` no error (closing with a proper 'end')
`while (1)` error
